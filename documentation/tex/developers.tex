\paragraph{}
So you want to build a depot client? The easy thing to do would be to
kill a man with a pitchfork and then wrap him in cheesecloth. Barring
that, here's how to go about it

\paragraph{}
Depot is an HTTP server, all depot commands are proper HTTP requests
and delivered as HTTP responses \footnote{There are plans in the works
  to expose various depot API's so that developers can write direct
  bindings. If you are interested, please contact us at
  developers@snepo.com for more information}. This presents a
particularly easy path if the language you are developing in already
provides HTTP client libraries (most do). Those developing their
own HTTP libraries as well will benefit from reading the Appendix. % TODO

HTTP Content is served by depot over the following request methods

\snepolistbox{
  \item GET
  \item PUT
  \item DELETE
  \item \textit{TODO: OPTIONS}
}

The standard HTTP method POST is treated as a PUT for the time being.
