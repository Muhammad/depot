Introduction
-------------------------------
Depot is a data engine that gives you fast, reliable
persistent data storage with zero administration.
Start the server and within minutes you can store and
retrieve data using the supplied JavaScript or Flash
clients.

We have also included a simple http server that proxies
http requests to Depot. It is not intended for
production web site hosting but it gets you up and
running quickly. In the future you can setup Apache
or IIS to proxy requests to Depot.

Alternatively if you are using Depot locally Flash can
connect directly to port 2323 (default Depot port).
